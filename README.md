# jme3-wishlist

- asset manager -- too closed, too complex, no way to customize logic, hardcoded asset locator chains
- the gui bucket hell -- just let go
- the awful font support -- need to have an official TTF plugin
- lack of a working gui library/tool -- 
- the texture caching problems -- allow more control of whether to keep the textures in RAM when they've been already loaded to VRAM
- physics -- 
- sound --
- post processing is overly complex and hard to optimize --
- animations --
- make the fonts batchable --
- support only a single importer that work --
- maybe the new gltf importer --
